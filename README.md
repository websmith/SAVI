# SAVI

### A simple javascript website monitoring application
SAVI was designed to be an elegant way to track uptime/downtime for websites you manage.

Currently this app is in a non-release phase of development, but feel free to use the code and learn from it. To get started, create a free account with [Uptime Robot](http://uptimerobot.com). Then enter your API key into the config.js file.
